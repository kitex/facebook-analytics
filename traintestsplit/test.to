Ncell, What a poor customer service delivery from your representative (the one who picked my call in 9005 last night from 9801416478). I was talking about your poor network connection these days in Phidim, Panchthar and seeking some solutions but I was adviced to do something else. Feeling shame on being Ncell user.
